# Background
SQL sublanguage: DQL (Data Query Language)

In this lab we are going to learn how to retrieve all the records from a table.

The syntax for retrieving all rows and columns from a database table looks like the following:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

NOTE: the * is a wildcard character to retrieve all the columns from the table.
